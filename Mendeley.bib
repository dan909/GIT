	abstract = {Fulfill the practical potential of DOE–with a powerful, 16-step approach for applying the Taguchi method Over the past decade, Design of Experiments (DOE) has undergone great advances through the work of the Japanese management guru Genechi Taguchi. Yet, until now, books on the Taguchi method have been steeped in theory and complicated statistical analysis. Now this trailblazing work translates the Taguchi method into an easy-to-implement 16-step system. Based on Ranjit Roy's successful Taguchi training course, this extensively illustrated book/CD-ROM package gives readers the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and apply the Taguchi method to engineering projects–from theory and applications to hands-on analysis of the data. It is suitable for managers and technicians without a college-level engineering or statistical background, and its self-study pace–with exercises included in each chapter–helps readers start using Taguchi DOE tools on the job quickly. Special features include:},
